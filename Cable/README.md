Echo Cable
==========

To input headphone audio to the microphone, it requires a special cable with a few resistors and capacitors.

There are a few such commercial products that we can buy on Amazon such as [3.5mm TRS Microphone Input Jack to TRRS Smartphone Adapter](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/dp/B01DVCA53U).

Note that there are many similar products but not working as expected. Most of the products are for output iOS device music to the speaker or headphone, which doesnâ€™t work for this purpose, such as [3.5mm Audio Cable with Lightning Connector](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HM792ZM/A/belkin-35mm-audio-cable-with-lightning-connector).

If you want to make it manually, refer to the following schematic.

You may also use [Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter) or [USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU7E2AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter), depends on your iOS device.

Schematic
---------

Here is a schematic of the circuit of the cable.

![Schematic](Resources/schematic.png)

- `JP1` is for input from 3.5mm audio headphone jack.
- `JP2` is for output to 3.5mm audio headphone jack with microphone input. See the following section about the details.
- `R1`, `R2` and `R3` are to reduce headphone level about -20dB.
- `C1` cuts direct current.
- `R5` is to let iOS devices recognize there is a microphone connected.

You can omit `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, `R4` if you want to make it simple, however, `C1` and `R5` are required at a minimum.

This diagram is based on [Audio Loopback Dongle](https://source.android.com/devices/audio/latency/loopback).

iOS device 3.5mm headphone jack
-------------------------------

All iOS devices use 4 pins 3.5mm Tip Ring Ring Shield (TRRS) headphone jack that comes with left, right audio output with a monaural microphone and control input, which is based on CTIA pinout.

That means, each pin is for left, right, GND then microphone in this order from tip to shield.

Implementation
--------------

You can implement this circuit inside of each end of the 3.5mm audio jack header.
